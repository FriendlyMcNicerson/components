/**
 * The {@code ComponentProperties} class contains the definitions of the properties associated
 * with a components. These definitions contain enough information to automatically
 * construct a nice looking user interface (UI) to populate and validate the properties. The objective
 * is that no actual (graphical) UI code is included in the components's definition
 * and as well no custom graphical UI is required for most components. The types of UIs that
 * can be defined include those for desktop (Eclipse), web, and scripting. All of these
 * will use the code defined here for their construction and validation.
 * <p>
 * All aspects of the properties are defined in a subclass of this
 * class using the {@link Property}, {@link Layout}, {@link Form}, and {@link Wizard} classes.
 * In addition in cases where user interface decisions are made in code, methods can be added to the subclass
 * to influence the flow of the user interface and help with validation.
 * <p>
 * Each property can be a Java type, both simple types and collections are permitted.
 * In addition, {@code ComponentProperties} classes can be composed allowing hierarchies
 * of properties and collections of properties to be reused.
 * <p>
 * Properties can be grouped into {@link Form} objects
 * which can be presented in various ways by the user interface (for example, a wizard page, a
 * tab in a property sheet, or a dialog).
 * <p>
 * A {@link Wizard} can be defined which is a sequence of forms.
 * <p>
 * Methods can be added in subclasses according to the conventions below to help direct the UI. These methods
 * will be automatically called by the UI code.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code before&lt;PropertyName&gt;} - Called before the property is presented in the UI. This
 * can be used to compute anything required to display the property.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code validate&lt;PropertyName&gt;} - Called after the property value has been entered in the UI.
 * This will return a {@link ValidationResult} object with any error information.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code beforeForm&lt;FormName&gt;} - Called before the form is displayed.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
